A Metabase driver for Datomic.

Work in progress. Sponsored by Eleven.

## Design decisions

There is a mismatch between Metabase's table+column view of the world, and
Datomic's mix-and-match entity+properties approach. This driver uses certain
heuristics to map the latter onto the former.

Any attribute prefix (namespace) is considered a table name. Any entity that has
an attribute with that prefix is considered to be a "row" in that table. Any
attribute in any such matching entity is considered a column of said table.

## Developing

To get a REPL based workflow, do a git clone of both `metabase` and
`metabase-datomic`, such that they are in sibling directories

```
.
│
├── metabase
└── metabase-datomic
```

Before you can use Metabase you need to build the frontend. This step you only
need to do once.

``` shell
cd metabase
yarn build
```

Now `cd` into the `metabase-datomic` directory, and run `bin/start_metabase` to
lauch the process including nREPL running on port 4444.

``` shell
cd metabase-datomic
bin/start_metabase
```

Now you can connect from Emacs/CIDER to port 4444, or use the
`bin/cider_connect` script to automatically connect, and to associate the REPL
session with both projects, so you can easily evaluate code in either, and
navigate back and forth.

Once you have a REPL you can start the web app. This also opens a browser at
`localhost:3000`

``` clojure
user=> (go)
```

The first time it will ask you to create a user and do some other initial setup.
To skip this step, invoke `setup!`. This will create a user with username
`arne@example.com` and password `dev`. It will also create a Datomic database
with URL `datomic:free://localhost:4334/mbrainz`. You are encouraged to run a
datomic-free transactor, and
[import the MusicBrainz](https://github.com/Datomic/mbrainz-sample)
database for testing.

``` clojure
user=> (setup!)
```

## Installing

Run `lein uberjar` and copy the result into your Metabase `plugins/` directory.

```
cd metabase-datomic
lein uberjar
cp target/*.jar ../metabase/plugins

cd ../metabase-datomic
lein run -m metabase.core
```
